# International Showcase Fund for music creators

## Support of up to £5,500 for UK artists to perform globally

PRS Foundation's International Showcase Fund (ISF) offers crucial financial support to UK music creators looking to break into global markets.

Run in partnership with the British Council, the fund covers travel, accommodation, visas, and other essential costs for artists invited to perform at high-profile international showcases, such as South by Southwest (SXSW) or WOMEX.

You may be eligible to apply if you have:

- a proven track record of success in the UK music industry
- a formal invitation to perform or create music at a major international music event
- clear evidence that attending will boost your career

Other eligibility criteria apply. For full details, see ISF guidance and FAQs.

Music creators can apply for funding directly, or a representative can apply on their behalf. Representatives who can submit applications include managers, record labels, publishers, booking agents, PR teams, or lawyers.

Successful applicants can receive grants of up to £5,500, depending on the showcase and their specific needs.

### When to apply

ISF operates on a rolling deadline due to the large number of eligible global events. There are over 50 eligible events each year.

It's best to apply as soon as possible after receiving an official invite, ideally 10-12 weeks before the showcase. For high demand events, specific application deadlines may apply.

For detailed guidance, deadlines, and application forms, visit the PRS Foundation's International Showcase Fund page.

# International Showcase Fund

## PRS Foundation

The International Showcase Fund (ISF) offers vital export support for UK-based artists, bands, songwriters and producers who have been invited to perform or create new music at international showcasing festivals or conferences.

ISF will also support UK-based music creators throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to remain export ready, with grants available to support: virtual performances at international showcases, or performances at UK based showcase events that have an export industry audience.

An ISF Grant can support the following activities:

- For Artists/Bands: ‘In Real Life’ attendance of international showcase events
- For Artists/Bands: Virtual attendance and engagement in International Showcase events via live-stream or pre-recorded performances, plus digital conference attendance
- For Artists/Bands: Virtual or ‘In Real Life’ performance at UK-based events where there is an export focus and a significant international delegation, plus conference attendance
- For Writer/Producers: ‘In Real Life’ attendance of song-writing camps which are geared towards international collaboration, creative and career progression
- For Writer/Producers: Virtual attendance at a song-writing camp which is geared towards international collaboration, and creative and career progression.

You can also apply for up to £1,000 towards the cost of a manager to accompany you/support you.

As showcases generally have short stage turnaround times, and generally just involve linechecks – our advice is that it’s better to rely on the in-house crew. If in certain circumstances you are travelling with a Tour Manager rather than your manager, or other crew please explain in the application why they are required for the specific showcase you are applying for, please do note that partners will prioritise the costs associated with getting the music creator/band to the showcase i.e. travel/accommodation.

If an artist’s disability or accessibility requirements warrant additional support – please see additional access needs section for more information.

ISF runs on a rolling deadline due to varying event organiser schedules. We recommend you apply for funding soon after being invited to showcase in order to give our panel of industry experts and partners enough time to consider your application to turnaround a decision as quickly as possible.

As a rough guide, our experts consider applications 2-3 months before showcase events take place. While the processing of visas is entirely your responsibility, it can take 3 months for some territories. For this reason, we prefer to receive applications 10-12 weeks prior to the event taking place and must receive applications at least 8 weeks prior to the event taking place.

Am I eligible for support from the International Showcase Fund? Are you a band/artist/songwriter based in the UK? Do you write and/or perform your own music, that is exceptional? Have you been invited to perform or participate in real life or virtually at the following: an international event, with a conference element, that is geared towards music industry professionals, rather than the general public at a UK based event that has a clear export focus and is geared towards non-UK international music industry professionals, rather than the general public in a songwriting camp which is geared towards international collaboration and creative and career progression** Have you got a good profile in the UK (i.e. been featured in the national press/had airplay on national radio/and indie release)? Do you have a list of meetings with music industry executives (e.g. publishers, labels, agents, etc.) confirmed for when you are at your chosen showcase? Do you have a strong business case for attending this specific event (e.g. are you building upon prior success there, or following up on significant buzz surrounding your band in that particular country)? Are you in need of funding support and not in a situation where other companies can and should cover the relevant costs of your in real life or virtual participation?***

** We will prioritise supporting songwriters at camps associated with international showcasing and conference events but welcome applications for one-off writing camps. For longer-term songwriting career development, including international activity, see the Hitmaker Fund

** Can signed artists apply? The International Showcase Fund can and often supports artists and music creators signed to record labels, publishing companies and those working with existing team members. However, you will be asked when applying which companies you are working with and why ISF support is still needed, and advisors and partners may feel based on your application that support is not required. We expect to see financial contributions from medium-large companies who will benefit financially from the applicant being supported with public and private funding via the International Showcase Fund.

We encourage applications from DIY/self-releasing artists and from those signed to independent labels when still in need of support. If you are signed to a major label or major affiliated label or publisher in the territory you are travelling to, you are ineligible for ISF support and should not apply.

Eligible events are those that have a mostly international music industry audience or delegation. This applies in the current Covid-19 pandemic across International Showcase events, virtual attendance at international showcase events and song-writing camps, and UK events^ with an export focus and non-UK based music industry audience.

The fund cannot support artists to play at festivals for the general public, or to attend conferences solely as a delegate. Support for UK-based showcase activity is considered on case-by case basis, where partners deem them to be strategically important with priority always going towards showcases in international markets. Please contact the grants team for clarity ahead of an application.

A new report on the impact of PRS Foundation’s International Showcase Fund (ISF) has revealed that from 2019-2024, the fund has helped to generate £6.7 million for the UK economy and has benefitted the careers of hundreds of music creators across the country.

It also shows that the fund has helped to tackle barriers for artists from underrepresented backgrounds, enriching the global music scene and representing music from across the whole of the UK.

The report also highlights the need for further investment following Brexit, the cost-of-living crisis and bureaucratic restrictions.

## A vital tool for artists to expand their reach and audience outside the UK

Established in 2006, the ISF provides artists, bands, songwriters, producers and their team members with the opportunity to apply for support to travel to and perform at international showcase events and songwriting camps.

Dave Webster, MU Head of International comments “The Musicians’ Union has been a long standing, proud partner of the ISF. Despite the challenges facing musicians touring outside the UK, the figures in this report show the value and importance of the ISF and what showcasing brings to musicians and the wider UK economy.”

International showcasing plays a pivotal role in the career development of emerging creators, providing a platform to present their work to key industry players across borders. As well as enabling them to enter new territories and reach new audiences, these opportunities allow music creators to nurture relationships with a range of stakeholders across the industry.

“Simply put, without the ISF there are several fantastic opportunities offered to artists to help grow their careers that they would have to decline due to the financial strain of the costs of playing.” says Charlie Williams, Manager of the London-based trio Honeyglaze.

## The fund is successfully reaching artists from underrepresented backgrounds

The report also showed that the ISF is successful reaching a broad range of grantees from all backgrounds including women and music creators of Black, Asian and other ethnically diverse heritage.

57% of grantees identified as women, gender-diverse music creators or were in mixed gender groups, marking a significant increase from previous rounds. 25% of grantees identified as LGBTQIA+, and 12% reported having a long-term health condition and/or impairment affecting their day-to-day life.

The fund is also reaching beyond the traditional music heartland of London. 46% of grantees within England were based outside London, and the fund supported creators in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The MU fully supports the ISF’s aim to support emerging creative talent in all its diversity and help shape a fairer, more equitable music industry.

## More investment in the music export industry is crucial for a thriving creative community

While showcasing events and equivalent activities are still extremely effective for artists to expand their networks and fast-track their careers, accessing these opportunities has become more expensive and difficult post-Brexit, post-pandemic and during a cost-of-living crisis.

Emerging artists and creators are feeling the impacts of these issues acutely, and the report highlights how further investment in the music export industry is crucial to building a thriving creative community.

“In a fast-changing ecosystem, and within the context of increased costs, bureaucratic restrictions, and increased competition, it is clear that ISF support is more crucial than ever,” says Joe Frankland, CEO of PRS Foundation.
