The Developing Your Creative Practice (DYCP) fund is designed to help creative practitioners take their work to the next level by providing them with the time and resources to focus on their own creative development.The fund supports a wide range of creative practices, including music, writing, visual arts, and more.It aims to help artists develop new skills and ideas that will enrich their practice and career.The funding can be used for various activities such as working with mentors, developing new work, or exploring new ways of working.Nina Clark used the DYCP funding to focus on her artistic development by reducing time spent on teaching and delivering sessions in order to concentrate more on her own creative tasks such as rehearsing, recording, songwriting, blogging, vlogging, and performing.

Applicants must be individual artists or practitioners who are looking for support in developing their own practice.The fund is open to a wide range of disciplines including music artists like singers/songwriters.

Applicants need to demonstrate how the funding will help them develop their practice in a significant way.They must outline what they intend to do with the funding and how it will impact their career.

Nina Clark's experience with DYCP highlights its potential impact; she was able to reboot her creative practice by focusing more on her own work rather than teaching others.Her project included creating a vlog for fan engagement and producing a music video for her latest single.# Developing your Creative Practice

Funding to support individuals who are cultural and creative practitioners and want to take time to focus on their creative development.
