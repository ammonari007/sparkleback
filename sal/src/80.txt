## What's the fund for?

**This fund is designed to help emerging artists and professionals develop the skills needed to participate in the fast-moving music industries. **Modern creatives are having to be more versatile than ever, and we want to see young people challenging themselves to adapt to the modern climate. This could be developing skills like video editing, graphic design, coding alongside their artistic venture.

You can apply to develop a project that you can run and deliver mostly yourself. Here are some examples of ideas:

- A creative music project: a Single, EP or contribution towards an album campaign. The music can be already made or in the process of being created.
- A music-based business: starting a record label or music platform.
- A platform that supports underrepresented voices and perspectives: Supporting leaders that build communities and help facilitate others in pursuing their creative goals.
- An event or series of events showcasing other emerging artists: This is a new option for 2022. We want to support new promoters and help new artists gain experience performing on stage.

All projects need to be released within a year of being awarded the funds, and ideas that aren’t accessible to the general public cannot be funded. For example, it couldn’t fund a training course with no project outcome.
