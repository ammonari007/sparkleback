Application Advice

Contacting Us

The following are considered by PRS Foundation to be Music Creators:

- songwriters,
- composers, or
- artists, bands, producers and performers who are writing their own music or commissioning other songwriters or composers

**Activities we can support:**

- projects involving the creation, performance or promotion of new music by living, UK-based music creators (e.g. a commission, residency, education project or tour)
- recording costs
- programmes that strongly feature or are based around new music (e.g. promoting a series of live events featuring outstanding new music, the new music component of a festival programme, artist/composer/talent development programme or multiple commissions)
- equipment/rehearsal space hire if it is an essential part of the project
- administrative costs (e.g. time spent organising the project, letters, printing, stamps)
- development time (e.g. the time it will take the music creator to work on the new material)
- Music Creator fee (to cover your time and work)
- promotional activity/PR costs relating directly to your development as a music creator/the project
- website creation (only if crucial to the promotion of the project)
- music videos when part of wider project activity
- musician fees (we will not fund a project if you do not pay your musicians)
- international activities when part of majority-UK based project (restricted to 30% of grants request)
- contingency (up to 10% of the total project budget)
- concerts, record launches, gigs, tours, installations, festivals and promoters which feature a significant programme of new UK music.

**In response to changing music creator needs we will now consider support for the following, all on a case by case basis:**

- Funding for live broadcasted or pre recorded online performances through streaming services if this adheres to social distancing rules and is within Government guidance at the time.
- Funding for promotion and marketing that does not involve a live performance, with the condition that a live performance is planned for a later date
- Funding for writing and creation that does not involve a live performance, under the caveat that a live performance (or an online alternative) is planned in the future.
- Applicants can apply for equipment costs up to a maximum of 20% of their project budget
- Music Creator Time / Music Creator Fees – we always encourage applicants to include music creator fees for creation and expect during the pandemic that more applicants will include fees for their own time and work. This might help you to cover or contribute to the time you put into the creation of new music, to cover professional losses or costs relating to working from home.^
- ^Because there is no music sector-wide standard, we are unable to offer guidance on a suitable daily or hourly rate for music creator fees. However, we encourage you to ensure a fair proportion of your costs are allocated to music creator fees where possible. PRS Foundation staff will ensure that our external advisors approach decisions in a consistent way across all genres, challenging the ‘norm’ that Contemporary Classical applicants receive music creator fees and those working in other genres do not.

**What changes have been made to the Open Fund and Women Make Music for 2022?**

The Open Fund and Women Make Music are now a one-stage application process instead of two, this means that you will be asked to provide details about the project, how it will benefit the creators involved, the activity timeline and a balanced budget in one application form.

Having received positive feedback from a more diverse range of applicants to video-based applications we are giving Music Creator and Women Make Music applicants the option to choose between written answers OR a video submission to decisive questions. *

While the application form may seem longer, we’ve broken down the decisive questions into individual questions so that you have more space (written) to adequately answer the questions and we’ll be launching new video application guidance this year to further support applicants through the application process.

**Please ensure that your video is accessible for at least three months from the deadline date as we cannot accept responsibility for your video link being inaccessible and you will not receive support. *

**What are the pros and cons of written and video submissions?**

Both written and video submissions have their pros and cons, video applications can enable applicants who are less confident in writing applications in answering the questions in the application form and vice versa, we will work with our Grants Team and advisors to mitigate unconscious bias through video submissions however, we would recommend those who are worried about this specifically to submit a written application. Please speak to a member of the Grants Team should you wish to discuss this further.

**Applicants with access requirements**

PRS Foundation is UK’s leading funder of new music and talent development. Investing in the future of music by supporting talent development across the UK with crucial and timely grant support, PRS Foundation enables songwriters and composers of all backgrounds to realise their potential create exceptional new music and reach audiences across the world.

Elizabeth Sills joined PRS Foundation in 2016 and works across the Open Fund and Women Make Music funding schemes, as well as Musician in Residence Programmes. Elizabeth has a broad range of experience in talent development and grant management from previous roles including with Help Musicians UK.

If you're thinking of applying for PRS Foundation funding, be sure to check out Elizabeth's top tips below.

First things first, it's important to make sure that you are applying to the right fund. Check the criteria and make sure that you are eligible for what you're applying for.

At the moment, our Open Fund and Women Make Music schemes are open for application with a deadline of 12 February. These funds run three times a year, so it you are not ready for this round check out our next deadline.

The Open Fund for Organisations offers up to £10,000 to support new music projects led by promoters, talent development organisations, venues, festivals and large performance groups over 12 people.

The Open Fund for Music Creators offers up to £5,000 to support the development of talented music creators (songwriters, composers and producers) of all genres and backgrounds at different stages of their career.

Women Make Music offers up to £5,000 in targeted support for the development of outstanding women, trans and non binary songwriters and composers of all genres and backgrounds at different stages of their career.

### Now you've chosen your grant, here's some advice...

-
The Open Fund and Women Make Music focus on development project grants and support things such as commissioning, recording, touring, writing time, and rehearsal and development space. With these funds, we are unable to support marketing costs, unless they are part of a wider campaign involving live and or recorded music.

- Before you start your application we recommend that you look at the eligibility criteria. Music creators must be based in the UK and the funding must be for the creation, performance or recording of new music. Find out more.

-
If you are applying for a live or virtual performance, think about the longevity of the work. We do not fund one off live performances, so include details for recording or extra performances that relate to this activity.

- The application is designed have limited word counts, so we recommend that you express how this project will develop the music creators involved and take them to the next step and why now is the right time. That 'next step' could be developing their audiences, having a specific recording pushing them forward to more live touring, time to develop new work or collaborating with other artists. A list of our grantees is available on our website. It can be useful to see what things have been funded in the past when applying for your own project.

- We have now designed the application so that you can apply in writing or by video, so use which one works best for you.

- As part of the application we will ask you to submit two examples of your music. Our advice would be to use the best and most relevant music example you have and do not use anything that is over 18 months old.

- We use independent advisors to help us assess multiple applications. We recommend that you make sure that all the information you would like advisors to see is on your application and that you do not rely on them looking up information about you.

- Do not rush your application, note the deadlines and if possible have another person read over it before you submit.

- Our applications include project budgets so make sure that the budget balances and makes sense. The expenditure and income of the project must equal the same. We would also advise for you to break down the budget costs in the description line.

- Please include the amount that you are applying for within the budget and put in other forms of income as PRS Foundation cannot fund the 100 percent of the costs of projects. We also advise that you apply for other funding that is available for you. Applying for other grants will not affect your application, but please make sure that it doesn’t seem as though you can do the project without our funding!

-
PRS Foundation cannot fund retrospective projects, so make sure that your activity happens after the decision date. It takes 10 weeks to assess the Open Fund and Women Make music so if you are applying for this deadline, your project should take place after 23 April 2021.

- We understand the impact COVID-19 has had on music creators and organisations who support talent development, so we are flexible on what we can fund at this current time and will accept applications for digital engagement, and socially distanced activity if it fits within the government guidelines at the time.


We hope that these tips are useful. The process is competitive and there is around a one in 12 chance of being successful. We do provide feedback so if you are unsuccessful please do phone in on a feedback day and chat to our team, it may be useful for future applications.

Good luck!
