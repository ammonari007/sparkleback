They need to submit applications ideally 10-12 weeks before their showcase event due to visa processing times which can take up to 3 months in some territories.\",\"other\":\"The ISF is successful in reaching a broad range of grantees from diverse backgrounds including women and ethnically diverse heritage groups.\"}]}"
