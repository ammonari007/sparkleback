### The world’s only independent funding and professional development programme designed exclusively for artist, songwriter, DJ and producer managers, Accelerator offers a combination of financial and educational support – including 12-month grants of up to £12,000, alongside expert-led professional development training.


Launched in 2019, the Accelerator Programme was developed to help independent artist, songwriter, DJ and producer managers build greater commercial sustainability. As demonstrated by findings from the MMF’s long-running series of Managing Expectations reports, a majority of independent music managers continue to face significant financial and structural challenges.

Many operate with acute employment insecurity and often spend years developing the careers of their clients, shouldering an increasing array of responsibilities, without the benefit of a safety net. According to MMF research, 61% of managers make less than minimum wage and supplement their earnings with other external work.

With the backing of YouTube Music, as well as long-term partners PPL, Arts Council England and the Scottish Music Industry Association, Accelerator has helped to address these dilemmas. The programme offers a unique combination of financial and educational support – welcoming a new cohort of managers each year, and providing them with grant funding (up to £12,000 will be available in 2025 for each successful applicant) as well as expert-led training on all aspects of the modern music business. Accelerator has also developed an incredibly strong peer-to-peer network, where managers from different backgrounds can share experiences, information and advice.

Since 2019, 133 individuals have completed the programme – with 90% still operating as music managers and continuing to build careers for talent from the UK and overseas. Some of the artists, songwriters and producers represented by Accelerator alumni including Joy Crookes, Shygirl, Wes Nelson, PinkPantheress, Joy Anonymous, ENNY, Nippa, Joesef, Dry Cleaning, YolanDa Brown OBE, Absolute x Dot Major, Ren, Porridge Radio, Skinny Living, Baltra, Bimini and Caskets. Accelerator has also enabled the MMF to greatly expand the support of managers to all corners of the UK, boosting those who play a lynchpin role in developing local music scenes or who operate in specific genres.

Of the 18 managers who took part in 2024’s programme, eight are based in London, with the others situated across a multitude of towns and cities, including Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Durham, Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester and Motherwell. Importantly, 2024’s participants have also reported an average 18% increase in their year-on-year earnings.

**Applications close at 12 pm / Noon ON MONDAY 3rd March 2025.**

The application process is in two stages;

**STAGE 1 – Expression of Interest and Video/Audio application Open –**

This stage of the application is intended to give us an overview of you and your work. The application form is available here and you will also need to submit a five-minute video.

**THE FORM: BASIC INFORMATION**

- How long have you been operating as a manager?
- What is the gross income of your artists’ businesses over the past 12 months and a breakdown in which areas this income has been earned and any net profit made?
- What is the overall income of the artist/songwriter/producer business in the past 12 months INCLUDING pipeline income?

**THE FIVE-MINUTE PITCH**

- We suggest taking approximately 1 minute per question to make a concise and clear answer.How long have you been operating as a manager and how did you come to the role?
- Tell us a bit about the artists you work with and why you work with them?
- Tell us about an achievement or success you’ve had in the past 12 months
- Tell us about a time you’ve failed or could have done better in the past 12 months

Applicants accepted to Stage 2 will be expected to submit a short 24-month plan (April 2025 – March 2027). More details will be announced soon. For any further information or queries, please email accelerator@themmf.net

**IS THERE A PARTICULAR AGE I HAVE TO BE TO APPLY?**

Accelerator aims to help you to the next stage of your management career and we encourage applications from all age groups above 18 years old. You must be able to demonstrate you have been professionally working as a music manager for at least 18 months.

**IF THE ACT I WORK WITH IS BASED IN THE UK, CAN I STILL APPLY EVEN IF I AM NOT?**

No, you need to be living in the UK to apply and participate in the programme, however, the music makers you represent may be living anywhere in the world.

**HOW PROFESSIONAL DOES MY FIVE-MINUTE VIDEO NEED TO BE?**

We are more interested in what you say in the video than your skills in video production. In previous years the range of Stage 1 successful applicants’ video styles was very broad and using a cameraphone was adequate. If you are unable to film a video please contact accelerator@themmf.net

Our advice is to keep the video clear, answer the questions required and keep within the five-minute time frame. We are unable to watch beyond five minutes of each submission.

**£25,000 SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO HAVE EARNED, CAN I STILL APPLY IF MY ACT HAS NOT EARNED THAT MUCH?**

We expect all eligible applications to meet these criteria. Don’t forget that this is GROSS income – as in anything the artist has received or is owed. This can include for example PRS, PPL, merch sales, advances, streams, grants, live income, brand income etc. If you sit down and work it all out, you may be surprised that your clients have turned over more than you thought.

**WHAT IF I AM WORKING WITH A CO-MANAGER?**

You can still apply if you are working in partnership with another manager but we ask you to detail this in the application. If you are both applying as individuals, please email accelerator@themmf.net to confirm the names that are applying either as individuals or as management partnerships. If you are applying as a partnership representing the same artists it is unlikely we will award two places on the Music Manager Accelerator. If in your partnership you are unsure which of you should apply, in general, it is suggested it would be the co-manager more responsible for business relationships such as those with accountants, lawyers etc.

**WHAT IF I MANAGE TWO ACTS THAT BETWEEN THEM HAVE EARNED OVER £25,000 BUT NOT INDIVIDUALLY?**

You will make a stronger application if you work with at least one act that has individually earned over £25,000. However, you are eligible if you reach this total across several music makers.

**DO I NEED TO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SAME ACT FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS?**

No; as long as you have been managing artists, songwriters, producers or DJs for at least 18 months, you are eligible to apply for the programme.

**HOW MUCH OF THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMME WILL I BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND OVER THE 12 MONTHS?**

You will be required to attend regular Accelerator training opportunities which take place during core “term times” weekly and a two night retreat.

The **Music Managers Forum (MMF) **and **YouTube Music** are delighted to announce that applications for the 6th year of the **Accelerator Programme for Music Managers** are now open.

The deadline for submissions is **10am Monday 26th February 2024**. Full details can be found here.

Launched in 2019, Accelerator remains the world’s only independent funding and professional development program designed exclusively for artist, songwriter, DJ and producer managers.

The programme offers a combination of financial and educational support – including direct investment of up to £12,000 per participant in the form of grant funding, alongside regular expert-led sessions on all aspects of the modern music business. The programme concludes with managers attending a two-night retreat with a focus on leadership skills and commercial planning – with the overriding goal of helping participants to build long-term, sustainable businesses across different genres of music.

For Accelerator’s 2023 cohort, this meant a stay at Selina Margate where their retreat involved sessions with speakers including MMF Chair, Paul Craig, and Board members Niamh Bryne and Ross Patel, alongside special guests Lyor Cohen, Global Head of Music, Google & YouTube and Dan Chalmers, Head of Music EMEA, YouTube Music.

To date, Accelerator has supported more than 115 individuals from across the UK – including managers of Joy Crookes, Shygirl, PinkPantheress, FLO, Eliza Rose, Joy Anonymous, Moses Boyd, Enny, Nafe Smallz, Squid, Joesef, S1MBA, Moonchild Sanelly, The Reytons, Steam Down, Shygirl, Dry Cleaning, Employed To Serve, Yolanda Brown, Wes Nelson, Shabaka Hutchings, Goat Girl, Bree Runway, Porridge Radio and Caskets.

A report published last year to celebrate five years of Accelerator’s successes illustrated how the programme has generated at least £9.4m in turnover for artists and talent represented by participants.

Collectively, Accelerator alumni have worked on eight UK Top 40 singles (including a Number 1) and 13 UK Top 40 albums. Two former participants – Clare Sanders-Wright and Nike Durosaro – currently sit on the MMF board.

The MMF is especially proud of the diversity of managers supported by Accelerator. To date, over 50% of participants are based outside of London, 42% have been female and 43% have been from Black, Asian or Ethnic backgrounds.

Accelerator has also received support since 2019 from **Arts Council England**, **Creative Scotland **and the **Scottish Music Industry Association**.

**Paul Bonham, Professional Development Director, MMF**:

*“Accelerator has become more than a programme. This is now a thriving network of managers that allows successful candidates to share information while providing funding and career-changing opportunities to learn from industry-leading experts. With the incredible support we’ve received from YouTube Music, Arts Council England, Creative Wales, Creative Scotland and the SMIA, we are incredibly proud of the programme’s track record to date and strongly encourage independent managers from every background to make an application.”*

**Dan Chalmers, Head of Music EMEA, YouTube Music: **

*“Year on year, we are blown away by the creativity, ambition, resilience and entrepreneurship that we see from the Accelerator managers, and the successes speak for themselves. It just goes to show what can be achieved through the potent combination of raw talent, industry guidance & mentorship and community. Accelerator is the gold standard of music industry development programmes, and in partnering with them for a sixth year we are proud to provide vital support to the next generation of music managers.” *

**Michelle Walker, London Area Director, Arts Council England**:

*“We’re thrilled to see the continued success of the Accelerator Programme, a scheme that we have proudly supported since its inception. Now in its sixth year, this programme does so much to support the development of upcoming music producers, offering excellent opportunities and equipping those involved with the skills needed to take the music industry by storm. This is the first round of the programme since The Music Managers Forum became one of our National Portfolio Organisations and we can’t wait to see what amazing talent is nurtured in the years to come.”*

**Robert Kilpatrick, CEO & Creative Director, Scottish Music Industry Association (SMIA):**

*“The SMIA has been a proud partner of the MMF Accelerator Programme since its inaugural year. As the organisation which exists to strengthen, empower and unite Scotland’s music industry, Accelerator plays a key part in our strategic work; better equipping Scotland-based music managers with the knowledge, skills and networks to develop both themselves and the artists they work with. The impact of the programme is undeniable, and we look forward to continuing to work with the MMF, YouTube Music and the wider project partners on this incredible initiative.”*

Several managers from Accelerator’s 2023 cohort have also encouraged managers to submit applications for 2024’s programme.

**Nina Smith, Tuff Cookie:**

*“For me Accelerator has provided a lot of social proof within the industry, and it’s been invaluable to be affiliated with the programme when it comes to networking, developing new partnerships and building my own artists’ businesses. The community aspect of Accelerator is also really important. Management can be really lonely work, but this has plugged me into a whole community of like minded individuals which has been fantastic – especially for someone like myself who’s based outside of London.” *

**Kariss Andrew, Karizma Management:**

*“Accelerator has massively benefitted my business for the fact that I’ve been introduced to all these different managers, across all different genres and different walks of life, who I ordinarily wouldn’t have been able to meet. We’re all placed in one room and we can all learn off each other. The benefits are actually really difficult to measure, but it’s been the best thing I’ve done in my career for sure. The grant is definitely an incentive to apply, and that allows you to take a few more risks, but it’s the community aspect that’s absolutely massive.*

*“My advice for anyone who thinks they’re ready is just to go for it. Do the application, and get a good business plan together. You’ll not regret it. It’ll change your company, it’ll change your business and you’ll learn so many new things.”*

**Deadline for submissions: Monday 26th February 2024 at 10am.**

Tobi Mwa, manager of Nippa, who was among 2024’s cohort:

“The Accelerator was a great experience, providing access to invaluable resources and insights essential for building a sustainable business. Through the programme, my network expanded significantly, and the knowledge gained has directly contributed to our long-term growth. I’d highly recommend any manager to apply for the 2025 programme to take advantage of this incredible opportunity.”

Aimmi Dunsmuir, Machina Management, who was also on 2024’s programme:

“Accelerator has been invaluable, equipping me with the tools, insights, and community to grow as a manager over the past year. With the support of MMF and YouTube Music, I’ve expanded my roster and launched my own label - an ambition I’ve held for a long time. I’d encourage any manager looking to take their career to the next level to apply, as the programme provides the guidance and opportunities needed to build an impactful future in the music industry. Its future sustainability is vital to ensuring upcoming talent in our industry has the support needed to thrive.”

Martha Cleary, Glow Artists, another Accelerator 2024 participant, added:

“Having started Glow Artists as an independent manager in 2023, I'm not sure where I'd be without the Accelerator Programme. The training, business insights and the industry connections have been invaluable. Most of all, the support and encouragement offered by the MMF’s Paul Bonham, Laura Erinle and Annabella Coldrick is so appreciated. I have new friends amongst my fellow Accelerators, and my strategy is much more focused moving forward.”

Paul Bonham, MMF, Professional Development Director:

“It’s no great secret that the current music industry is a ball of confusion and a tsunami of opportunities - or that managers are increasingly expected to solve its challenges on behalf of their clients. But while it’s exciting being at the epicentre, the pressures can be overwhelming and the role can be isolating.

“Accelerator is part of the MMF’s antidote to these challenges, providing the leaders of tomorrow with much-needed support, as well as access to a vibrant peer-to-peer network. We’re incredibly grateful to have the continued support of YouTube Music, PPL, Arts Council England and the Scottish Music Industry Association that enables us to deliver this career-boosting programme that benefits all in the industry. ”

Maddy Smith, Artist Partnership, YouTube Music:

“For the seventh year, we're thrilled to support the Accelerator Programme. Our partnership with the MMF on this initiative has been one of our most fruitful and rewarding collaborations and every year we are excited to work closely with a new group of managers to help them navigate the ever evolving challenges of music management. We love the sense of community, innovation and diversity that is central to the Accelerator Programme and we as the music team at YouTube are proud to be supporting the next generation of talent.”

Peter Leathem OBE, CEO of PPL:

"We are delighted to be supporting the Accelerator Programme for Music Managers once again. Managers regularly put their artists careers and development first but they also need the infrastructure in place for their own development so they can support their clients to the best of their ability. The programme enables managers to collaborate and learn from their peers, as well as hear from a range of industry experts on key areas so they can build sustainable and healthy careers for themselves and the talent they represent."
