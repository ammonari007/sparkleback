Accelerator aims to help you to the next stage of your management career and we encourage applications from all age groups above 18 years old. You must be able to demonstrate you have been professionally working as a music manager for at least 18 months. IF THE ACT I WORK WITH IS BASED IN THE UK, CAN I STILL APPLY EVEN IF I AM NOT? No, you need to be living in the UK to apply and participate in the programme, however, the music makers you represent may be living anywhere in the world. HOW PROFESSIONAL DOES MY FIVE-MINUTE VIDEO NEED TO BE? We are more interested in what you say in the video than your skills in video production. In previous years the range of Stage 1 successful applicants’ video styles was very broad and using a cameraphone was adequate. If you are unable to film a video please contact accelerator@themmf.net. Our advice is to keep the video clear, answer the questions required and keep within the five-minute time frame. We are unable to watch beyond five minutes of each submission. £25,000 SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO HAVE EARNED, CAN I STILL APPLY IF MY ACT HAS NOT EARNED THAT MUCH? We expect all eligible applications to meet these criteria. Don’t forget that this is GROSS income – as in anything the artist has received or is owed. This can include for example PRS, PPL, merch sales, advances, streams, grants, live income, brand income etc. If you sit down and work it all out, you may be surprised that your clients have turned over more than you thought. WHAT IF I AM WORKING WITH A CO-MANAGER? You can still apply if you are working in partnership with another manager but we ask you to detail this in the application. If you are both applying as individuals, please email accelerator@themmf.net to confirm the names that are applying either as individuals or as management partnerships. If you are applying as a partnership representing the same artists it is unlikely we will award two places on the Music Manager Accelerator. If in your partnership you are unsure which of you should apply, in general, it is suggested it would be the co-manager more responsible for business relationships such as those with accountants, lawyers etc. WHAT IF I MANAGE TWO ACTS THAT BETWEEN THEM HAVE EARNED OVER £25,000 BUT NOT INDIVIDUALLY? You will make a stronger application if you work with at least one act that has individually earned over £25,000. However, you are eligible if you reach this total across several music makers. DO I NEED TO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SAME ACT FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS? No; as long as you have been managing artists, songwriters, producers or DJs for at least 18 months, you are eligible to apply for the programme. HOW MUCH OF THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMME WILL I BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND OVER THE 12 MONTHS? You will be required to attend regular Accelerator training opportunities which take place during core “term times” weekly and a two night retreat.\"]}]}"
