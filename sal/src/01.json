"{\"opportunities\":[{\"name\":\"Women Make Music\",\"organization\":\"PRS Foundation\",\"funding\":\"\u00a30-\u00a35,000\",\"details\":\"Women Make Music supports women and gender minority music creators to increase their profile and stimulate new collaborations. Funding is available to support the creation, performance, and promotion of outstanding new music in any genre by UK-based music creators. The fund aims to break down assumptions and stereotypes within the music industry by encouraging role models for future generations, raise awareness of the gender gap, increase the profile of women, trans and non-binary artists creating new music in the UK, and encourage those who may not have applied for PRS Foundation funding to do so. The fund supports high-quality new music projects but does not cover core organizational costs or living expenses. It is open for application three times a year with a deadline on 12 February.\",\"eligibility\":\"Applicants must be women or gender minority artists/composers or music creators working in any genre. They must be UK-based with a track record of more than 18 months. Ineligible applicants include individuals in full-time education (unless an exception is made), under 18s (unless represented by an adult with a valid DBS check), those resident outside of the UK, those without a track record of more than 18 months, projects where the lead composer/songwriter is a member of another Performance Rights Organisation.\",\"application_requirements\":\"Applicants can choose between written answers or video submissions for decisive questions. They must submit two examples of their music that are not over 18 months old. Applications should include project budgets that balance expenditure and income as PRS Foundation cannot fund 100% of project costs.\",\"other\":\"Previous recipients include Anna Meredith, ESKA, Emma-Jean Thackray among others.\"}]}"
