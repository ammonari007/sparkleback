Launched as part of an effort by PRS Foundation and partners after reflecting on musically outstanding talent based outside London who were not yet at crucial career tipping points sought in main Momentum guidance but showed strong potential for future development.





## PPL Momentum Accelerator

PPL Momentum Accelerator is a targeted scheme to support the development of outstanding artists and bands who are writing their own music, and future Industry Professionals, outside London and who face additional barriers in reaching a crucial career tipping point based on their location.

Previous recipients include English Teacher, L E M F R E C K and Piss Kitti.

Through the evaluation of our PPL Momentum Music Fund and evidence from thousands of applications PRS Foundation receives each year, we identified talent pipeline gaps across the UK. Many music creators show strong musical potential but are unable to capitalise upon this due to financial barriers, gaps in regional infrastructure, knowledge, advice, and access to industry platforms.

PPL Momentum Accelerator’s long-term approach supports the development of these outstanding artists and bands outside London, with partners providing support for a number of future industry professionals such as managers, promoters, record labels, music publishers, booking agents, to bolster regional scenes across the UK.

Launched as a pilot in Liverpool in 2019, PPL Momentum Accelerator runs in Liverpool City Region, Yorkshire and Wales.

The activity that funding would support must take place in the UK.

Industry Professionals applying for PPL Momentum Accelerator will be able to demonstrate a good or growing track record in working behind the scenes in Liverpool City Region or Wales, to support music creators in those areas but face barriers to reach or get beyond crucial early career tipping points.

As a general rule, we prefer for applicants to wait until their previously funded project is complete before applying for other funding schemes.

Furthermore, PPL Momentum Accelerator grantees cannot reapply to Accelerator and must instead apply to PPL Momentum for suitable projects – something that is actively encouraged at least 12 months after Accelerator grant support is offered.

**Deadlines: click here**

All applications must be submitted by 6pm on the day of the deadline.

When applying, keep in mind that we can only support activity happening after the decision date for your deadline – this will mean your activity must be at least 8 weeks after the deadline.

*All deadlines are subject to change – check guidance regularly*

If you have read all the guidance and checked the deadlines page

**What are the most common reasons applicants are unsuccessful?**

Many applicants meet our funding criteria and score well. But high demand means we have to prioritise the highest scoring applications. The competitive nature of this fund is in most cases the reason an application has not been funded.

- Some applications are ineligible (e.g. applying for activity that is happening before the decision date).
- Applicants applying for 100% project costs from PRS Foundation are unlikely to be selected (we are unable to support full project costs).
- The activity plan submitted did not demonstrate how funding would have a significant impact on their careers.
- The activity did not highlight clearly why funding is needed.
- The application did not show enough confirmed provisional activity in detail.

**What is a crucial career tipping point?**

PRS Foundation understands that the journey for each music creator is unique, and therefore we are not prescriptive as to what constitutes a crucial career tipping point as this will vary between music creators. However, we do expect that applications can demonstrate a strong UK-wide fanbase and national press/radio coverage, have at least one team member and are in a position to make significant creative and professional development following a PPL Momentum award.

It is worth noting that once you have received PPL Momentum Music Fund you are ineligible for further support from the PRS Foundation except through our International Showcase Fund award.

**Can I apply to the PPL Momentum Music Fund and another scheme such as the Open Fund for Music Creators?**

We advise applicants to only apply to the funding scheme that they feel best fits their career level and project.

**As an Artist Manager, can I apply for costs to cover my time project managing?**

Many applications are made by artist managers on behalf of individual artists and bands. Artist managers make a significant contribution in terms of planning, managing and implementing planned Momentum projects.

Since launching in 2013, PRS Foundation has found that in many cases artist managers are contributing financially to ensure a project goes ahead. We expect and plan for this trend to continue, particularly where established managers and large management companies are involved.

In the vast majority of cases, PPL Momentum Music Fund support has had a significant impact on long-term income generation for the artist and their management team.

Since April 2018, and following advice from the Music Managers Forum (MMF), PRS Foundation recognise that for many artist managers industry trends have presented significant barriers to entry and income uncertainty. As a result, artist managers who are able to justify project management cost allocations may include a fair sum under ‘Artist Manager Project Management Contribution’ within the Expenditure Section of the Momentum Budget.

The ‘Artist Manager Project Management Contribution’ will be considered by independent advisors and PPL Momentum partners on the following basis:

- We will prioritise expenditure which directly and significantly impacts on the career development of the artist*,
- A maximum of 15% of the total Momentum request amount can be attributed to ‘Artist Manager Project Management Contribution’,
- Any contribution made to cover project management costs must be justified within the application and in a separate question in the Budget section of the Momentum application form.
- Where it is possible for the artist manager or management company to contribute to the costs of the project we expect the application to include income contribution from management**
- Any resulting grant offers are agreements between PRS Foundation and the artist and grant support is paid to the artist. In the event that the artist terminates their working relationship with the artist manager before or during the proposed Momentum project activity timeline, any monies allocated to ‘Artist Manager Project Management Contribution’ shall be reclaimed by PRS Foundation and reallocated fairly at the discretion of PRS Foundation following consultation with both parties,

* Please weigh up the potential long-term impact of your project management contribution against the potential impact on your artist’s development of spending the grant elsewhere

** The artist’s offer amount may be reduced if independent expert advisors recommend that management could or would otherwise be contributing financially to the proposed project.

PRS Foundation also encourages artist managers to state the in-kind value of their support on the project within the ‘in-kind income’ box below the budget.

**Am I eligible to apply if I am signed to a major?**

If you are signed to a deal with one of three large major record labels (Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group) then it is highly unlikely you would be eligible for PRS Foundation support through PPL Momentum Music Fund.

If you are currently signed to a major label or publisher on a traditional record deal model you are likely ineligible for PRS Foundation support. However, we understand that new models and deal types can result in uncertainty. Should you be concerned and want to discuss further please get in touch to discuss your application with the grants team directly via info@prsfoundation.com

This would also apply to any subsidiary labels from these majors.
