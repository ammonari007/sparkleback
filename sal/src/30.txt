# GMCA Inspire Fund

The GMCA Inspire Fund is providing grants of £500 – £2,000 for freelance and independent artists, and small organisations across Greater Manchester.

You may be a musician who would benefit from a new instrument, a small group who needs funds to expand your wardrobe or replace costumes, or a freelance artist who wishes to upskill via a training course.

*The GMCA Inspire Fund is managed by Salford CVS, on behalf of 10GM.*

## Closed for applications!

In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been found and reported that the level of investment and support for freelancers, independent creatives, artists, musicians, and performers across the arts could be improved, with many freelance artists leaving the sector.

Following extensive consultation, the need for a focused, small investment into the creative sector was highlighted. This led to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) establishing the Culture Fund to support the regrowth and strengthening of the creative sector in Greater Manchester.
