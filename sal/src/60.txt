## What the fund supports

The fund will continue to support organisations to **deliver a wide range of creative activity**.

This includes funding for:

- a specific
**one-off project or production**or - a period of
**creative research and development**or - a
**longer term programme of work**.

It can also support organisations to undertake **business and organisational development **that will:

- enhance their
**business sustainability**through the development of new or more diverse income streams

or

- consider
**broader organisational development**costs.

Examples of the types of activity that the fund can support can be found in the Guidance for Applicants below. It is not exhaustive and is provided to give applicants an indication of the types of activity that can be applied for. If you have any queries about what you are wanting to apply for, please contact our Enquiries Service before starting your application.

## Eligibility

Any type of constituted artistic, creative or cultural organisation based in Scotland can apply, but as the funding comes from the National Lottery, and is intended to support activity that maximises public benefit, any project that seeks support for commercial activity where the primary purpose is to create a profit is unlikely to be successful.

For full eligibility information, read the Guidance for Applicants.

Eligible organisations can apply for funding between **£1k and £100k **for projects or programmes lasting **up to 18 months**.

We have sample budgets available to support you in your application:

As standard, if your application request is between £500 and £20,000 you will hear the outcome in 10 weeks. If your application request is between £20,001 and £100,000 you will hear the outcome in 14 weeks.

To accommodate the office closure over the Christmas and New Year period:

Open Funding is one of Creative Scotland’s key funding routes, supporting the wide range of activity initiated by organisations, artists, writers, producers and other creative practitioners in Scotland.

We have separate strands for organisations and individuals, so they are not in competition with each other for funds. These strands have separate budgets and applications are considered at separate panels.

If you’re an individual artist, writer, producer or other creative practitioner based in Scotland, you can apply to the Open Fund for Individuals.

If you’re an organisation, you can apply to the National Lottery Open Fund for Organisations.

## Individual meetings

Please note that due to the unprecedented demand on the Open Funds at present, all Creative Scotland staff are fully focused on processing and assessing these applications. Individual meetings with officers to advise on future applications or give feedback on past applications are therefore not currently possible.
